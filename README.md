# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

## Superstore Dataset

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Superstore Dataset, with a focus on understanding sales performance, profitability, discount strategies, and product behavior over time. The analysis combines descriptive statistics, visual exploration, and design principles to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
The main objective of the project is to investigate why certain product categories and sub-categories such as Copiers and Paper generated higher profits over the observed period (2014–2017), analyzing changes in sales volume, pricing, and discount strategies.

## Visualizations

Bar charts

Line plots

Box plots

Heatmaps

Choropleth maps

Multi-panel (compound) plots
